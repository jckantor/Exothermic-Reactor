Simulation and Control of an Exothermic Stirred Tank Reactor
============================================================

*Simulation and Control of an Exothermic Stirred Tank Reactor* is an interactive demonstration of feedback control for an exothermic, continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). It is intended for use as lecture demonstration of feedback control for a strongly nonlinear system, and to reinforce control concepts through homework exercises. 

## Running

You can open and run the notebook directly from a browser window by clicking on this button:

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/jckantor/Exothermic-Reactor)

This will open the notebook in your browswer with calculations done in the 'cloud'.  This is the most convenient way to use the notebook without installing anything on your own computer, tablet, or phone.

## Downloading

The simulation is self-contained in a single Jupyter notebook. If you have Jupyter/Python installed on your computer, you can download by opening the notebook on github and clicking the download icon.

Alternatively, you can fork or clone the whole project from this [github repository](http://github.com/jckantor/Exothermic-Reactor).
